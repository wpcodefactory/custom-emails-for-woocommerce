WooCommerce by default allows you to send emails based on several triggers (that are located under WooCommerce Settings >> Emails) like "New order", "Failed order" and so on.

Our plugin allows you to add more emails than the defaults one by WooCommerce.

Our plugin‚Äôs numerous configuration options allow for full control over what you can do with it. You can notify your customers when order status changed to "Completed", or only when it changed from "Pending payment" to "Completed".

You can also add custom emails based on custom order statuses you have in your store, and these are automatically added to the plugin's triggers list. And with multilingual support you can expand your reach for the whole world not just English-speaking countries.

Our customers really love this plugin, read the full description to learn about all of its features and understand why they‚Äôre loving it.
