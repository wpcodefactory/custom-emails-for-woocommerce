Add custom emails to WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**Custom Emails for WooCommerce** plugin lets you add custom emails to WooCommerce.

### &#9989; Main Features ###

* Set custom email **trigger(s)**. For example, send email when order status changed to "Completed", or only when it changed from "Pending payment" to "Completed". Custom order statuses are automatically added to the plugin's triggers list. You can choose from numerous triggers, like sending email on a new order, or when order was fully or partially refunded, or when note was added to the order. In addition you can set non-order emails, like sending an email to admin if anyone's password was reset, or new customer was created, or when a product is on backorder, and so on...
* **Delay** emails. For example, send custom email one week after order was "Completed".
* **Require/exclude order product(s)** - sent email only if there were selected products, product categories or tags in the order.
* Set **minimum/maximum order amount** - minimum/maximum order amount (subtotal) for email to be sent.
* Require/exclude order **payment gateways** or **shipping methods**.
* Require/exclude order **user roles** or **users**.
* Set **subject**, **heading** and **content**. You can use the plugin's [shortcodes](https://wpfactory.com/docs/custom-emails-for-woocommerce/) or standard WooCommerce email placeholders here.
* **Attach files** to the custom emails.
* Set **email type** - choose which format of email to send (plain text, HTML, multipart). Optionally wrap email in **WooCommerce email template**.
* Send emails **manually**, for example, from the **Order actions** meta box on single order edit page, or in bulk from the **Bulk actions** dropdown on admin orders list.
* Set email **recipient(s)** - customer, admin, custom email address.
* Set email's **admin title**.
* **WPML** and **Polylang** compatible.
* **"High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)"** compatible.
* And more...
